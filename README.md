# Maxee 1.0.0

If you love and use ExpressionEngine, and you're a MaxCDN user, then this add-on is a must have. It provides a simple and easy way to view quick stats and purge cached files from right within the ExpressionEngine Control Panel.

## Install

After downloading and decompressing, put the maxee directory in your third_party folder, then install the module from the ExpressionEngine modules page in ExpressionEngine.

You will need to enter your MaxCDN API credentials on Maxee's settings page. After you have done this, you'll be able to view and manage any zones you have mapped to the supplied API credentials.
